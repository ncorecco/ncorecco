## About Me:
I am 26 years old and graduated in Computer Science from ETH Zurich, majoring in Machine Intelligence and minoring in Theoretical Computer Science. I am a curious person who enjoys understanding how algorithms and models work. I value teamwork and believe that collaboration and sharing ideas lead to better solutions.


## Some projects I've worked on recently:
**Monte Carlo Mean-Field Game Approach for Large Auctions**. (Master Thesis) Proposed and analyzed the Monte Carlo MFG method for stochastic settings, establishing theoretical bounds on exploitability. Designed and extended MFG formulations for sequential first-price auctions, including models with hidden and public states, demonstrating their effectiveness in modeling complex auction dynamics. Introduced a sequential multi-item auction framework for large agent populations, proving convergence of the MFG-Nash policy without continuity or Lipschitz assumptions. Empirical experiments validated theoretical findings and showcased practical applications in large-scale auctions.
  
[SUBER: An RL Environment with Simulated Human Behavior for Recommender Systems](https://github.com/SUBER-Team/SUBER) (Paper accepted at ECAI 2024): A framework for synthetic environments that simulate human behavior by harnessing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We complement our framework with in-depth ablation studies and demonstrate its effectiveness with experiments on movie and book recommendations. By utilizing LLMs as synthetic users, we introduce a modular and novel framework for training RL-based recommender systems. 

[Learning to Bluff and Cooperate: RL in Briscola](https://github.com/TiCinesi/Learning-to-Bluff-and-Cooperate) We construced a multi-agent Briscola (italian card game) environment and trained RNN-based agents using  reinforcement learning.
